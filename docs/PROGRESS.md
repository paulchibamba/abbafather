# Progress

**Read this first in a new session.** It says what is done, what is next, and what "done" means for the
next task. Supporting detail: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`,
`CLAUDE.md`. The design has already been transcribed into `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — there is no need to
fetch the Claude Design project again.

## What this app is

**Abba, Father** — a quiet, offline prayer companion. Browse a catalogue of historic, Scripture and
Puritan prayers; pray one line-by-line in a dark full-screen session with a breathing pause; keep lines
you love; write your own prayers. No accounts, no network, no notifications.

Each task is built on its own branch, verified, then **stopped for approval**. Only after approval:
`git switch main && git merge --no-ff <branch> && git tag task-<nn>`.

## Task 3 — done and merged

Everything below the UI. The visible app is still the design-system gallery, as planned.

- **Domain** (pure Kotlin): `Prayer`, `PrayerGroup`/`PrayerKind`/`PrayerTheme`, `SavedLine`,
  `PersonalPrayer`, `PrayerCollection`, `PrayerSettings`/`SessionPacing`, `Greeting`, `PrayerFilter`;
  the four repository interfaces; the seven use cases; `util/IdGenerator`.
- **Data**: `AbbaDatabase` v1 over seven tables (`prayers`, `prayer_lines`, `prayer_themes`,
  `saved_lines`, `personal_prayers`, `prayer_collections`, `collection_members`), four DAOs,
  `AbbaTypeConverters`, `mapper/PrayerMappers`, four repository implementations, `SettingsDataStore`.
  Schema exported and committed at `app/schemas/io.abbafather.data.local.AbbaDatabase/1.json`.
- **Seed**: `assets/prayer_catalogue.json` — 31 prayers, 280 lines, the design's 7 included. Parsed by
  `CatalogueSeeder` in `RoomDatabase.Callback.onCreate`, guarded twice (see `docs/DECISIONS.md`).
- **DI**: `DatabaseModule`, `RepositoryModule` (`@Binds`), `TimeModule` (`Clock`, `IdGenerator`).
- **Tests**: 39 passing — three Robolectric DAO classes, `CatalogueSeederTest` (seeds once, the seven
  named prayers are whole, the catalogue reads back through `PrayerRepository`), and seven use-case
  classes against hand-written fakes.
- `androidx.test:core` added to the version catalog for `ApplicationProvider` in unit tests.
- Verified: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` and `:app:testDebugUnitTest` both pass.

One thing to know: **"A Prayer in Distress" is attributed "After John Bunyan"**, not to Bunyan
directly — the design file was not available and no verbatim text of that title could be confirmed.
`docs/DECISIONS.md` records what to do if the design source turns up.

## Task 2 — done in this branch

- Cormorant Garamond (+ italic) and Work Sans bundled as variable TTFs in `res/font`; OFL licences in
  `assets/licenses/`.
- `core/designsystem/theme/`: `AbbaColorScheme` (+ `AbbaLightColors`, `LocalAbbaColors`),
  `AbbaFontFamilies`, `AbbaTypeScale` (+ `LocalAbbaTypeScale` and a derived Material `Typography`),
  `AbbaShapes`, `AbbaSpacing`, `AbbaTheme` (+ the `AbbaTheme.colors` / `AbbaTheme.type` accessors).
- `core/designsystem/component/`: `pressableSurface`, `SoftCard`, `PillButton` (+ `PillButtonDefaults`
  sage / card / tinted / translucentOnForest / oatOnForest), `TextActionButton`, `SectionLabel`,
  `BrandEyebrow`, `SelectableChip`, `TagChip`, `RoundIconButton`, `AbbaIcons` (8 icons transcribed from
  the design's SVG paths).
- The template's `ui/theme/` package and `Greeting` composable are gone.
- `MainActivity` currently shows `DesignSystemGallery` — a temporary proof sheet, replaced by the
  navigation host in task 4.
- Verified on an API 35 emulator: both faces render, all twelve colour tokens match, every component
  and all eight icons draw correctly, and the deep-forest section reads as intended.

## Task 1 — done and merged

- `git init` on `main`; template committed untouched as the first commit.
- **The template did not build as delivered** — `compileSdk` raised from 36.1 to 37 (see
  `docs/DECISIONS.md`).
- Version catalog rewritten: KSP, Hilt, Room, DataStore, Navigation Compose, kotlinx-serialization,
  lifecycle-compose, Turbine, Robolectric, coroutines-test.
- `android.disallowKotlinSourceSets=false` so KSP works with AGP 9's built-in Kotlin.
- `AbbaFatherApplication` (`@HiltAndroidApp`) registered; `MainActivity` is `@AndroidEntryPoint`.
- `core/common/Dispatchers.kt` (`@IoDispatcher`, `@DefaultDispatcher`, `@ApplicationScope`) and
  `di/CoroutinesModule`.
- Empty package skeleton created for every layer.
- Docs written: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- Verified: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` passes; Room + Hilt KSP codegen and Room schema export were
  proved with a throwaway entity that was then removed.

The UI is still the untouched template "Hello Android" screen. That is expected at this point.

## Start here for the next task

### Task 4 — `feat/04-app-shell-navigation`

```
git switch -c feat/04-app-shell-navigation main
```

The shell the screens will hang from. No screen content yet — each destination is a placeholder that
proves the route, the argument and the bottom bar behave.

- `navigation/`: `@Serializable` route types for `Home`, `Library`, `MyPrayers`, `Saved`, `Reader`,
  `Session`, `ComposePrayer` (arguments per the table in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`), `AbbaNavHost`, and
  `AbbaBottomBar` — the pill bar, sage active pill, 11sp uppercase labels, shown only on the four
  top-level destinations.
- Top-level tabs save and restore their back stacks:
  `popUpTo(graph.findStartDestination().id) { saveState = true }`, `restoreState = true`,
  `launchSingleTop = true`.
- `MainActivity` shows `AbbaNavHost` instead of `DesignSystemGallery`; the gallery composable stays in
  the tree for now as a preview surface but is no longer the app's content.
- Session is full-bleed: no bottom bar, and the shell must let it own the system bars.

**Done when** `:app:assembleDebug` and `:app:testDebugUnitTest` pass, every route is reachable, the
bottom bar hides on Reader/Session/Compose, and switching tabs restores each tab's scroll position.
